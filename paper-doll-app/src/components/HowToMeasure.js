            <h3>CHEST</h3>
            <p>Measure under your armpits, around your shoulder blades,
            and over the fullest part of your bust. Donâ€™t pull the tape 
            measure too hard.</p> 

            <h3>WAIST</h3>
            <p>Measure around your natural waistline. This is the 
            narrow part of your waist, 
            about an inch above your navel. Relax and breath out before
            you measure.</p>

            <h3>HIP</h3>
            <p>The hip should be measured around its fullest part 
            (about 8 inch. below your waist).</p>

            <h3>INSEAM</h3>
            <p>This is the measurement from your ankle to your groin,
             when you stand with your legs straight. If possible, ask a 
             friend to help you. This can also be measured on a pair of 
             pants with the proper length.</p>
